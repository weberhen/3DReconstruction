# 3DReconstruction
Our project will focus on 3D photography. More specifically, we will use an LP350 projector and an Xbox Kinect v2 RGB-D camera (for the RGB camera), both from the LVSN. Our goal is to construct a model of the geometry of the scene by projecting a series of fringes over the environment using the projector. With a series of images taken using distinct fringes, one can retrieve the 3D coordinates on the objectâ€™s surface. The output will be a point cloud and a mesh model.

Implementation based on the following paper:

Brink, Willie, Alan Robinson, and Marcos A. Rodrigues. "Indexing Uncoded Stripe Patterns in Structured Light Systems by Maximum Spanning Trees." BMVC. 2008.
